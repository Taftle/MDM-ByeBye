This is a script that you run after resetting your macbook, this works on silicon macs i am not sure about intel macs. This is not mine it was archived from the SkipMDM.com website because their new script does not work. Run:
git https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Taftle/MDM-ByeBye/main/SkipMDM
in the terminal in recovery mode and proceed with the steps shown in the terminal and you should be fine.
